        <p class="interestbio">
          I began studying linguistics when I was fifteen years old, having many modern and ancient languages under my belt. Throughout my time studying the science behind language, I gravitated toward ancient languages and what comparisons between them may signify. However, over the course of my journey, I have studied over ten languages across multiple language families and time periods, from modern Chilean Spanish to archaic Latin slang. I have published a book on the best methods for learning language, and given many talks surrounding a general theme about the importance of linguistics in academic environments. Currently, I am a classically trained linguist in Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and Classical Telugu, and I’m interested in their similarities and differences with both each other and also their modern counterparts.

        <p class="interestbio">
          At the age of ten, through my community, I began studying the ancient Indian language Sanskrit, and five years later, I took my first class in Latin. My love of classics sprouted from my early introduction to the ancient world. I saw many similarities between the culture of the Romans and my ancestors—the ancient Indians. As I started reading Latin literature, I immersed in not only the beauty of the language, but also the whole picture of the people reflected In the writing. These were not just stories; they were the thoughts, ideas, innovations of a person who once existed. With this perspective, I observed my own cultural stories differently, and started translating Sanskrit literature. When I came to college, I utilized my current skills in modern Telugu and Sanskrit to translate Classical Telugu. In addition, I used my own translations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses to create an original poetry collection about the mythological stories presented in the piece. Now, I am determined to add another notch to my belt as a classist: Ancient Greek. Within the classics, my passion lies in comparative literature; I’m interested in understanding the cultural differences reflected in the literature of these various societies.

        <p class="interestbio">
          With my extensive study of linguistics and the introduction of ChatGPT, I developed a curiosity to understand the inner workings of natural language processing. Having studied computational linguistics through other research projects, I had a good handle on the subject, but the application of these very conceptual ideas into something as concrete as a large language model (LLM) opened my eyes to the vast field of AI. As I studied the various deeper elements of what constituted an LLM, I found interest in the legal side of these matters, and how this was a very innovative and adaptive niche in law. From AI-generated art to training data, there are many unanswered questions about these new innovations—and I hope to be involved in finding the answers, both on the legal and technical sides.
