    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="aboutme">My name is Maanu, and I'm a sophomore at Emory University. I am pursuing a BS in Quantitative Studies with a linguistics concentration and a BA in Classical Philosophy. Professionally, I am interested in research about the relationship between data science and linguistics, specifically natural language processing, and how large language models are the future of technology. I'm also passionate about exploring digital humanities, and how computational methods can be used in literary analysis and linguistic pattern recognition.</p>

      <h3 class="interestname">Linguistics</h3>
      <p class="interestbio">
        I began studying linguistics when I was fifteen years old, having many modern and ancient languages under my belt. Throughout my time studying the science behind language, I gravitated toward ancient languages and what comparisons between them may signify. However, over the course of my journey, I have studied over ten languages across multiple language families and time periods, from modern Chilean Spanish to archaic Latin slang. I have published a book on the best methods for learning language, and given many talks surrounding a general theme about the importance of linguistics in academic environments. Currently, I am a classically trained linguist in Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and Classical Telugu, and I’m interested in their similarities and differences with both each other and also their modern counterparts.

      <h3 class="interestname">Classics</h3>
      <p class="interestbio">
        At the age of ten, through my community, I began studying the ancient Indian language Sanskrit, and five years later, I took my first class in Latin. My love of classics sprouted from my early introduction to the ancient world. I saw many similarities between the culture of the Romans and my ancestors—the ancient Indians. As I started reading Latin literature, I immersed in not only the beauty of the language, but also the whole picture of the people reflected In the writing. These were not just stories; they were the thoughts, ideas, innovations of a person who once existed. With this perspective, I observed my own cultural stories differently, and started translating Sanskrit literature. When I came to college, I utilized my current skills in modern Telugu and Sanskrit to translate Classical Telugu. In addition, I used my own translations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses to create an original poetry collection about the mythological stories presented in the piece. Now, I am determined to add another notch to my belt as a classist: Ancient Greek. Within the classics, my passion lies in comparative literature; I’m interested in understanding the cultural differences reflected in the literature of these various societies.

      <h3 class="interestname">AI and AI Law</h3>
      <p class="interestbio">
        With my extensive study of linguistics and the introduction of ChatGPT, I developed a curiosity to understand the inner workings of natural language processing. Having studied computational linguistics through other research projects, I had a good handle on the subject, but the application of these very conceptual ideas into something as concrete as a large language model (LLM) opened my eyes to the vast field of AI. As I studied the various deeper elements of what constituted an LLM, I found interest in the legal side of these matters, and how this was a very innovative and adaptive niche in law. From AI-generated art to training data, there are many unanswered questions about these new innovations—and I hope to be involved in finding the answers, both on the legal and technical sides.
